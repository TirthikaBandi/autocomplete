# autocomplete-19MCA0106
.
Autocomplete on a dataset of 80,000 words using django python based framework with trie data structure. The main search operation is based on trie data structure because of two reasons: 
1) time complexity for worst case is log(n) 
2) it is a version of tree that is specifically used for strings.

Although the data currently is taken directly from the txt file, but making use of django framework was done keeping in mind for the future scope. 

Languages used:
Frontend : HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, and JAVASCRIPT
Backend: PYTHON, rest_framework-DJANGO
Dataset: .txt file

Completed objectives:
1.	Designed the backend working algorithm(autocomplete-19MCA0106/AutoCompleteUI/autocomplete/templates/autocomplete/autocomplete.py ).
2.	Created a responsive frontend(autocomplete-19MCA0106/AutoCompleteUI/autocomplete/templates/autocomplete/index.html).

Unfinished tasks:
1.	Data is not passed from frontend to backend.
2.	Unable to make use of http methods for data passing.
3.	Testing not done.
